# 🔧 Domain Configuration Issue - Complete Fix

## Problem Identified!

आपके पास **two different hosting setups** हैं:

1. **Vercel** - जहाँ website actually चल रही है ✅
2. **AWS Amplify** - जहाँ आप domain setup कर रहे थे ❌

**Result:** DNS confusion causing SSL issues on mobile!

---

## 🔍 Current Status

### What's Actually Working:
```
✅ Website: Running on Vercel
✅ Domain: korakagazindia.com pointing to Vercel
✅ SSL: Vercel managed certificate
✅ Server: Vercel (confirmed by headers)
✅ DNS: vercel-dns.com nameservers
```

### What's Causing Problems:
```
❌ AWS Amplify: Trying to setup same domain
❌ DNS Conflict: Two hosting providers competing
❌ SSL Confusion: Multiple certificate attempts
❌ Mobile Issues: Certificate chain problems
```

## 🎯 Solution: Choose ONE Hosting Provider

### Option 1: Keep Vercel (Recommended) ✅

**Why Vercel is better for you:**
- ✅ Website already working perfectly
- ✅ Better performance (CDN)
- ✅ Easy deployments from GitHub
- ✅ Lower cost
- ✅ Better SSL management
- ✅ No server management needed

**Steps:**
1. **Abandon AWS Amplify setup**
2. **Keep domain pointing to Vercel**
3. **Fix SSL in Vercel dashboard**

### Option 2: Move to AWS Amplify (Not Recommended)

**Why not recommended:**
- ❌ Need to migrate entire website
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Higher cost
- ❌ Need to reconfigure everything

## 🚀 Quick Fix (Recommended)

### Step 1: Fix Vercel SSL

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Your Project → Settings → Domains**

4. **Add it back** (forces fresh SSL certificate)
5. **Wait 5-10 minutes**

### Step 2: Ensure Proper DNS

Type: CNAME  
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Step 3: Abandon AWS Amplify

1. **Go to AWS Amplify Console**
2. **Remove korakagazindia.com domain**
3. **Don't try to setup domain there**
4. **Focus only on Vercel**

## 📱 Mobile SSL Fix

### Why iPhone Shows Error:

```
Root Cause: DNS/SSL confusion between Vercel and Amplify
├─ Domain pointing to Vercel ✅
├─ But Amplify also trying to claim it ❌
├─ Certificate chain gets mixed up
└─ iOS Safari shows security warning
```

### Fix Steps:

1. **Complete Vercel SSL setup**
2. **Remove Amplify domain configuration**
3. **Wait for DNS propagation**
4. **Test on iPhone Safari**
